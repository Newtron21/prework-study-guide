A study guide for course pre-work

# <Pre-work Study Guide>

## Description

This is a pre-work study guide to help me remember notes about Javascript, html, css and coding in general. Then everything is in one place for easy access and I can refer back to it while I code.

I learned how to build a webpage from scratch and how to integrate terminal, git and git hub.

It solved the problem of information overload and making sure I am set up for success in this course.
